>**Disclaimer:** Using a TikTok viewbot is against the platform's Terms of Service. We do not encourage the act or idea of artificially increasing the number of views, likes, shares or favorites of your videos. The use of BotTok is at the user's own risk.

## Install

>**Attention:** To use Git and clone the repository you will need to have *SSH Public Key*. Take a look at this: [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
Without this you may have problems installing. This will make it much easier to upgrade your BotTok to the latest version available with a single command.

>The following installation commands are provided for each operating system. Execute the command corresponding to your OS and follow the instructions, choose the default values by pressing enter or typing Y as appropriate. At some point during the installation a public ssh key will be generated and you will need to paste it into your GitHub account to continue. You can look in this documentation in the manual installation of your OS at the "Add your SSH Public Key" step for more details. After doing this step you will need to press enter on the tarminal to finish the installation. If everything went well BotTok should open.

#### Android (Termux)

![](doc/5.png?raw=true)

Requirements: [termux](https://termux.dev/en/) (install Termux in your Android phone from F-Droid store, The PlayStore version ins outdated and not work)

There is no build of Google Chrome available for ARM at this moment, so using chromium instead.
Installing chromium on Termux directly requires snap which is another big hurdle so alternatively using alpine distro here.

1. Install [alpine](https://alpinelinux.org) in termux

```bash
$ pkg upgrade
$ apt update
$ apt upgrade
$ pkg install proot-distro
$ proot-distro install alpine
$ proot-distro login alpine
```

2. In alpine install chromium
```bash
$ apk update && apk add --no-cache nmap && \
    echo @edge http://nl.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/community >> /etc/apk/repositories && \
    echo @edge http://nl.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/main >> /etc/apk/repositories && \
    apk update && \
    apk add --no-cache \
    chromium
```

3. Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and [openssh](https://www.openssh.com/)
   
```bash
$ apk add nodejs
$ apk add yarn
$ apk add git
$ apk add openssh
```

4. Add your SSH Public Key to your GitHub account ([more info](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account?platform=linux)). In ssh-keygen use the default values (press enter)

```bash
$ ssh-keygen
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy its content and paste it into your GitHub account in [https://github.com/settings/ssh/new](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new)

![](doc/8.png?raw=true)


5. Clone this repository in terminal (fingerprint: yes)

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:jfadev/bottok.git
```

6. Install Bot Tok
```bash
$ cd bottok
$ yarn install
```

*Note:* To enter Alpine from Termux with [proot-distro](https://github.com/termux/proot-distro) use the following command:
```bash
$ proot-distro login alpine
```

## Update

#### Windows

1. Run in terminal

```bash
$ cd bottok
$ win-update.bat
```

#### Linux

1. Run in terminal

```bash
$ cd bottok
$ ./ubuntu-update.sh
```

#### Android (Termux)

1. Run in terminal

```bash
$ cd bottok
$ ./alpine-update.sh
```
*Note:* use `./ubuntu-update.sh` if instead of alpine you decided to use another distro like ubuntu for example.

## Use

Type the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ cd bottok
$ node bottok.js
```
And follow the instructions, solve the captcha in the console if necessary, choose one of the available tasks and let the bot work.

>**Attention:** On Windows you can open BotTok by simply clicking on the `win-bottok.bat` file.

>**Attention:** On Windows Chromium can have the problem of opening multiple windows. We can control another browser like Chrome present on your machine. For this we just need the path to chrome.exe and launch BotTok as follows:

```bash
node bottok.js -b "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\Chrome.exe"
```

## Options

```txt
Usage: node bottok.js [options]

Options:
  -h, --help             Show help
  -v, --version          BotTok version
  -l, --video <link>     TikTok video URL to perform the task on
  -t, --task <task>      Task to perform on the TikTok video (example: 'Up Views')
  -c, --cookies <file>   File path to store session cookies (default: cookies.json)
  -u, --user-agent <ua>  User agent to be used (default: random user-agent)
  -p, --proxy <proxy>    The proxy to be used (example: http://localhost:8080)
  -b, --browser <path>   Path to a browser executable to use instead of Chromium  
  -w, --no-headless      Open visible browser window  
  -k, --terminal-captcha Terminal captcha instead of auto solver  
  -o, --log              Write activity log (activity.log)
  -m, --minimal          Hide ASCII art header
```

## Advanced

##### Use Custom Cookies

```bash
$ node bottok.js -c cookies2.json
```

##### Use Proxy

```bash
$ node bottok.js -p http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

##### Use Custom User-Agent

```bash
$ node bottok.js -u 'Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; CPU OS 8_4 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/600.1.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/8.0 Mobile/12H143 Safari/600.1.4'
```

##### Use Custom Browser

Path to a browser executable to use instead of the bundled Chromium.
Note that Puppeteer is only guaranteed to work with the bundled Chromium, so use this setting at your own risk.

###### Linux
```bash
$ node bottok.js -b /usr/bin/google-chrome-stable
```

###### Windows
```bash
$ node bottok.js -b "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\Chrome.exe"
```

##### Run with Visible Browser Window

```bash
$ node bottok.js -w
```

##### Use Terminal Captcha in Premium

If the auto captcha solver has problems you can solve the captcha manually.
```bash
$ node bottok.js -k
```

##### Write Activity Log

Stored in the `activity.log` file

```bash
$ node bottok.js -o
```
Record structure:
[`datetime`] [`user-gent`] [`session-id`] [`task`] `total` (+`accumulations`) `URL`

## Premium (No Limitations)

The **FREE** version limited to **~5000** accumulations (views, likes, shares, etc...).

The advantage of acquiring the license is that the bot continues to 
work indefinitely and accumulates large amounts of views, shares, etc...
